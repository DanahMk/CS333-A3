# JavaScript API Data Retrieval and Visualization

## Assignment Overview
This project is part of the University of Bahrain's course on JavaScript and focuses on retrieving and visualizing student nationality data from the Bahrain Open Data Portal using their public API.

## Assignment Details

### Objective
In this assignment, we are tasked with creating a JavaScript application that retrieves data from the Bahrain Open Data Portal and displays it in a user-friendly table format. The table is designed to be responsive, ensuring a clean and organized view on various devices.

### Dataset
The dataset provides insights into the composition of the University of Bahrain's student body, focusing specifically on students enrolled in the IT college and studying a Bachelor's program. The data is accessed via a public API, and it includes information about student nationalities.
