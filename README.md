# JavaScript API Data Retrieval and Visualization

## Assignment Overview
This project is part of the University of Bahrain's course on JavaScript. It focuses on retrieving and visualizing student nationality data from the Bahrain Open Data Portal using their public API, using both JavaScript and PHP for data fetching.

## Assignment Details

### Objective
In this assignment, we created a web application that retrieves data from the Bahrain Open Data Portal and displays it in a responsive table format. The table uses Pico CSS for responsive design to ensure the content is presented in a user-friendly manner.

### Dataset
The dataset provides insights into the composition of the University of Bahrain's student body, specifically focusing on students enrolled in the IT college and studying a Bachelor's program. The data is accessed via a public API, and it includes information about student nationalities.

### Project Tasks
1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from the Bahrain Open Data Portal API using JavaScript (`fetch`) and PHP (`file_get_contents`).
2. **Data Parsing**: Parse the JSON response to extract relevant information and handle cases where data is unavailable.
3. **Data Visualization**: Display the parsed data in an HTML table using Pico CSS for responsive design.
